Q: What is a namespace?
A: Well, a namespace is a set of symbols used to organize objects so that you can refer to them by name. 

Q: What are value types?
A: The value type is the actual value.

Q: What are reference types?
A: A reference type is a reference to another value.

Q: What is an automatic property and how is it useful?
A: They are used to simplify putting private variables in a class while still having them be visible outside the class.

Q: What is the purpose of using statement?
A: It provides a syntax that ensures the correct use of IDisposable objects.

Q: What are dynamic type variables?
A: A dynamic type variable is used to tell the compiler a variable's type can change or it'll not be known until runtime.

Q: What is the purpose of the is operator?
A: The is operator is used to check the object type and returns a bool value of either true or false.

Q: What are generics and how is using them useful?
A: Generics are used to give your objects a strongly typed collection.

Q: What is the scope of a public member of a class?
A: The scope is the accessibility of the class and where it can be read from / written to.

Q:Can you create a function that can accept a varying number of arguments?
A: Yes you can.

Q: How do you sort an array?
A: By using Array.Sort

Q: What is a nullable type and what purpose does it serve?
A: They are special data types and they make it possible to assign a null to a value type. 

Q: What is an enumeration?
A: It's a set of integer constants.

Q: What is inheritance?
A: It is the ability to create a class that inherits attributes and behaviors from another class.

Q: Is multiple inheritance supported?
A: No it isn't.

Q: What is the purpose of as operator
A: It's similar to the is operator but instead of bool it returns object or null.

Q: What is an object?
A: An instance of a class that is made dynamically.

Q: What is the difference between a struct and a class?
A: Structs are value types and classes are reference types.

Q: What is the difference between continue and break statements?
A: With a break you can jump out of a loop while with a continue you can jump over one iteration and then resume the loop.

Q: What is this and how is it used?
A: It's used to reference the current instance of the class.

Q: What is try and catch and when are they used?
A: A try block is the block of code in which exceptions occur and a catch block catches and handles the exceptions of the try block.

Q: How is exception handling done?
A: It's done by using the keywords try, catch, and finally.

Q: What is finally and what is its purpose?
A: It is an exception handling keyword and its used for clean up of objects. 

Q: List the differences between Array and ArrayList.
A: An array is a datatype while an arraylist is a datatype collection.

Q: What is an object?
A: An instance of a class that is made dynamically.

Q: Define constructor.
A: A constructor is a method used to set default values, limit instantiation, and write code that is flexible and easy to read.

Q: When can var be used to declare a variable and how is the type for the variable determined?
A: It can be used when a local variable is declared and initialized in the same statement. 

Q: What is an abstract class?
A: An abstract class is a class that is declared without any implementation.

Q: What is an interface?
A: It's an abstract base class and can be used to get around not being able to use multiple inheritance in C#.

Q: What is a method?
A: A method is a group of statements that when put together, they perform a task.

Q: What is a property?
A: A property is a member that provides a flexible mechanism to read, write or compute the value of a private field.

Q: What is an access specifier?
A: They are keywords that set the accessibility of classes, methods and other members.

Q: What access specifiers are supported and what do they mean?
A: Private, which limits the accessibility of a member, public, which has no limits, internal, which is used to make your class members accessible in the assembly, protected, which means any protected type or member is accessible when a child is inherited by a parent and protected internal, which is a mix of the two.

Q: What is a collection?
A: They are specialized classes for data storage and retrieval. 

Q: What is a Hash Table?
A: A hash table is a collection of key-and-value pairs.
